# The_PINPIP_project

the Pininterest Data Pipeline project (no 3)

# Abstract

The purpose of this project is to build two types of data engineering pipelines, for processing both *batch* and *streaming* data from the Pinterest social media service. Distributed computing services (AWS Cloud) are employed, and the processed data sets are eventually stored in predisposed cloud S3 buckets. 

Here below an outline of the basic components of the ETL pipelines:

*Batch data*  
1. Amazon API Gateway  
2. Virtual Private Cloud: EC2 Instance  
        2a. Confluent-kafka-connect-s3  
        2b. Confluent kafka REST proxy  
        2c. Kafka consumer  
3. Amazon S3  
4. Databricks Notebook 

*Streaming data*  
1. Amazon API Gateway  
2. Virtual Private Cloud: Amazon Kinesis  
3. Databricks Delta Lake 

Here below a glimpse of the data sets:

They are encoded in json format, each readable with json_loads(<string that point to name>) into a python dictionary. There are three types of data sets as follows:

1. pinterest_data
	*post* {'index': 7528,'unique_id': 'fe34b356 xxxx' , 'title': 'No title', (description,poster_name,follower_count, tag_list,is_image_or_video,image_src,downloaded,save_location,category)}
	
2. geolocation_data
    *geo* {'ind': 7528, 'timestamp': xxx ,'latitude': ,'longitude': , 'country': }
    
3. user_data
    *user* {'ind': 7528, 'first_name':'Abigail', 'last_name':'Ali','age':'25','date_joined: cxxc}
    
In summary, there are 12 key-value pairs in *post*; 5 key-value in *geo*; 5 key-value in *usr*. Their *primary keys* are index/ind, which seem the same variable but with different name.

Noticeably, the time formats require pre-processing to conform to API time ISO standards. Moreover, the data is generated by a python emulator code, which mimics the actual pinterest data formats.
